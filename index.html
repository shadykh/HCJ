                    A Confederacy of Dunces is an American comic masterpiece. 
                    John Kennedy Toole's hero, one Ignatius J. Reilly, is "huge, obese, fractious, fastidious,
                     a latter-day Gargantua, a Don Quixote of the French Quarter. 
                    His story bursts with wholly original characters, denizens of New Orleans' lower depths,
                     incredibly true-to-life dialogue, and the zaniest series of high and low comic adventures" (Henry Kisor, Chicago Sun-Times).

                    In this award-winning Audible Studios production, 
                    Trevor Noah tells his wild coming-of-age tale during the twilight of apartheid in South Africa.
                     It’s a story that begins with his mother throwing him from a moving van to save him from a potentially
                    fatal dispute with gangsters, then follows the budding comedian’s path to self-discovery through
                    episodes both poignant and comical.
